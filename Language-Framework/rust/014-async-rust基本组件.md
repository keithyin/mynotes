# RawWakerVTable

虚表：虚表在C++中是一个函数指针表，指向虚函数，RawWakerVTable也是类似作用

```rust
/// 虚表：里面的成员都是函数指针，这也符合虚表的定义，存了一堆函数指针
pub struct RawWakerVTable {    
    clone: unsafe fn(*const ()) -> RawWaker,
    wake: unsafe fn(*const ()),
    wake_by_ref: unsafe fn(*const ()),
    drop: unsafe fn(*const ()),
}
```

关于 RawWaker

```rust
pub struct RawWaker {
    /// A data pointer, which can be used to store arbitrary data as required
    /// by the executor. This could be e.g. a type-erased pointer to an `Arc`
    /// that is associated with the task.
    /// The value of this field gets passed to all functions that are part of
    /// the vtable as the first parameter.
    data: *const (),
    /// Virtual function pointer table that customizes the behavior of this waker.
    vtable: &'static RawWakerVTable,
}

impl RawWaker {
    /// Creates a new `RawWaker` from the provided `data` pointer and `vtable`.
    ///
    /// The `vtable` customizes the behavior of a `Waker` which gets created
    /// from a `RawWaker`. For each operation on the `Waker`, the associated
    /// function in the `vtable` of the underlying `RawWaker` will be called.
    #[inline]
    #[rustc_promotable]
    #[stable(feature = "futures_api", since = "1.36.0")]
    #[rustc_const_stable(feature = "futures_api", since = "1.36.0")]
    pub const fn new(data: *const (), vtable: &'static RawWakerVTable) -> RawWaker {
        RawWaker { data, vtable }
    }
}
```



关于 `Waker`, 也就将 `RawWaker` 包装了起来，然后提供了一些方法

```rust
pub struct Waker {
    waker: RawWaker,
}

impl Waker {
    /// Wake up the task associated with this `Waker`.
    #[inline]
    #[stable(feature = "futures_api", since = "1.36.0")]
    pub fn wake(self) {
        // The actual wakeup call is delegated through a virtual function call
        // to the implementation which is defined by the executor.
        let wake = self.waker.vtable.wake;
        let data = self.waker.data;

        // Don't call `drop` -- the waker will be consumed by `wake`.
        crate::mem::forget(self);

        // SAFETY: This is safe because `Waker::from_raw` is the only way
        // to initialize `wake` and `data` requiring the user to acknowledge
        // that the contract of `RawWaker` is upheld.
        unsafe { (wake)(data) };
    }

    /// Wake up the task associated with this `Waker` without consuming the `Waker`.
    ///
    /// This is similar to `wake`, but may be slightly less efficient in the case
    /// where an owned `Waker` is available. This method should be preferred to
    /// calling `waker.clone().wake()`.
    #[inline]
    #[stable(feature = "futures_api", since = "1.36.0")]
    pub fn wake_by_ref(&self) {

        // to the implementation which is defined by the executor.

        // SAFETY: see `wake`
        unsafe { (self.waker.vtable.wake_by_ref)(self.waker.data) }
    }

    /// Returns `true` if this `Waker` and another `Waker` have awoken the same task.
    ///
    /// This function works on a best-effort basis, and may return false even
    /// when the `Waker`s would awaken the same task. However, if this function
    /// returns `true`, it is guaranteed that the `Waker`s will awaken the same task.
