# 增强学习

* deep learning for representation
* reinforcement for algorithm

**Reinforcement learning neural networks to approximate functions:**

* Policies   (select next action)
* Value functions (measure goodness of states or state-action pairs)
* Dynamic Models (predict next states and rewards)



How does RL relate to other ML problems?

* Supervised learning
  * Environment samples input-output pair ($x_t, y_t$)~$\rho$
  * Agent predicts $\hat y_t = f(x_t)$
  * Agent receives loss $l(y_t, \hat y_t)$
  * Environment asks agent a question, and then tells it the right answer
* Contextual bandits
  * Environment samples input  ($x_t$)~$\rho$
  * Agent takes action $\hat y_t=f(x_t)$
  * Agent receives cost $c_t\text{~} P(c_t|x_t,\hat y_t)$, $P$是一个未知的概率分布
  * Environment asks agent a question, and gives agent a noisy score on its answer.
  * Application: personalized recommendations
* Reinforcement learning
  * Environment samples input $x_t\text{~}P(x_t|x_{t-1}, y_{t-1})$
    * Environment is stateful: input depends on your previous actions
  * Agent takes action $\hat y_t=f(x_t)$
  * Agent receives cost $c_t\text{~} P(c_t|x_t,\hat y_t)​$, $P​$是一个未知的概率分布
